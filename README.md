# Smart-Pantry-System

Thia project is about to provide automated pantry refill system for hotels, home, restaurants.
In this system there is one android app which can be used for hotel pantry management tasks such as ordering required item to seller, checking pantry status, set to autobuy for pantry items, buyed and ordered item history. Also we can use this app as seller in which we can check order which seller have to place, his order delivery history.
Pantry status is detected by weight sensor and forwarded to web server which is implemented in php.
